# Employee-payroll-tracker

My Task

I have to modify a starter code to create an application that enables a payroll manager to view and manage employee payroll data. This app will run in the browser and will feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript code that I modify. It will have a clean and polished, responsive user interface that adapts to multiple screen sizes.

User Story

AS A payroll manager
THEY WANT AN employee payroll tracker
SO THAT THEY can see their employees' payroll data and properly budget for the company.

Acceptance Criteria

GIVEN an employee payroll tracker
WHEN THEY click the "Add employee" button
THEN THEY are presented with a series of prompts asking for first name, last name, and salary
WHEN THEY finish adding an employee
THEN THEY are prompted to continue or cancel
WHEN THEY choose to continue
THEN THEY are prompted to add a new employee
WHEN THEY choose to cancel
THEN their employee data is displayed on the page sorted alphabetically by last name, and the console shows computed and aggregated data

The following images show the web application's appearance and it's functionnality.
